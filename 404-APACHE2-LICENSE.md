   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE from the Work, provided that
       such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express
   or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
   conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or

   determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work
   and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
   under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### Key Differences from MIT

- ✅ **Explicit patent grant**: Contributors grant patent rights for their contributions
- ✅ **Patent retaliation clause**: If you sue us for patent infringement, your patent license terminates
- ✅ **More detailed**: Covers edge cases (trademarks, contribution submission, additional warranties)
- ✅ Better for: Enterprise adoption, complex organizations, patent-sensitive industries

### What This Means

You can:
- ✅ Use the framework for any purpose (commercial, personal, research)
- ✅ Modify the framework for your needs
- ✅ Distribute copies or modified versions
- ✅ Use it in proprietary projects
- ✅ Use patents from contributors (they can't sue you later for patent infringement)
- ✅ Fork the project under the same license

You must:
- ✅ Include the copyright notice and full license text in copies
- ✅ State significant changes to the code

You do NOT need to:
- ❌ Share source code of derivative works
- ❌ Contribute improvements back to the project
- ❌ Pay for any license

---

## 2. Paid Services (Optional, Separate From License)

The [PROJECT TEAM] offers optional paid services. **Using the core framework does not require purchasing these services.**

### Service Offerings

| Service | Description | Pricing Model |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Managed Hosting** | Fully managed cloud deployment with automatic updates, backups, scaling | $[X]/user/month |
| **Priority Support** | Direct access to engineering team, <4hr response SLA | $[Y]/month |
| **Training & Onboarding** | Custom workshops, documentation, knowledge transfer | $[Z]/engagement |
| **Custom Features** | Development of project-specific features | $[A]/hour + materials |
| **Enterprise SLA** | 99.9% uptime guarantee, dedicated support engineer | $[B]/month |

### Pricing Philosophy

Pricing is set below the "maximum acceptable price" per the 404Framework formula:

```
Max Acceptable Price = (Project Valuation / Active Users) × (1 - Churn Rate)
```

**Current Metrics** (updated quarterly):
- Project Valuation: $[X]
- Active Users: [Y]
- Churn Rate: [Z%]
- **Maximum Acceptable Price per User**: $[CAP]
- **Our Pricing**: [Our rates are X% of the cap]

## 3. Trademark Governance

[PROJECT] trademarks are managed by [NON-PROFIT FOUNDATION/COMMUNITY TRUST].

### Permitted Uses

✅ You can use the [PROJECT] name to:
- Describe your use of the framework ("Built with [PROJECT]")
- Reference the project ("We use [PROJECT] for...")
- Create derivative projects ("ProjectName [PROJECT] Plugin")

### Restricted Uses

❌ You cannot use the [PROJECT] name to:
- Imply official endorsement without explicit permission
- Sell a competing product under the [PROJECT] brand
- Create a fake "official" edition for licensing purposes
- Prevent others from forking or extending the project

### Trademark Change Governance

Any significant change to trademark policy requires:
1. 30-day public comment period
2. Contributor vote (75% supermajority)
3. Notification to all major derivative projects

---

## 4. Contributor Rights & Protections

### Your Contributions Are Your Own

When you contribute to [PROJECT], you:
- **Retain copyright** on your work
- **Grant us a license** to use your contribution under Apache 2.0
- **Can use your contribution** in your own projects under any license

**No CLA required.** Contributions are voluntary. You grant permission, not ownership transfer.

### Patent Contributions

If you contribute code containing patents you own:
- You grant [PROJECT] and its users a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to those patents
- This applies only to patents necessary for your contribution
- You retain ownership; we receive a license

### License Change Governance

The core framework license is Apache 2.0 perpetually. Any change requires:

1. **Public Proposal**: 30-day open comment period (minimum)
2. **Contributor Vote**: Only contributors can vote
   - Weighted by contribution volume (commits, reviews, issues)
   - Minimum 40% voter turnout required
3. **Supermajority**: 75% approval required
4. **Historical Preservation**: All versions under the original license
5. **Fork Rights**: Contributors can fork under Apache 2.0 if rejected

### What You're Protected From

- ❌ **License rug-pulls**: Core stays Apache 2.0 forever
- ❌ **Retroactive restrictions**: Old versions don't change
- ❌ **Ownership transfer**: Contributors retain copyright
- ❌ **Patent trolling**: Contributors grant perpetual patent licenses
- ❌ **Trademark theft**: Trademark held by non-profit, not corporate entity

---

## 5. Transparency & Accountability

Every quarter, [PROJECT] publishes a "State of the Framework" report:

**Engagement Metrics**:
- Active user count (MAU/DAU/Organizations)
- Churn rate (% lost per period)
- Geographic adoption

## 6. Sustainability Model

### How We Stay Alive

- **Paid services revenue**: Primary funding source
- **Enterprise support contracts**: Secondary revenue
- **Training & consulting**: Tertiary revenue
- **Sponsorships & grants**: Community support
- **Donations**: Optional community funding

### We Will Never

- ❌ Switch to SSPL, BSL, proprietary, or "fauxpen" licenses
- ❌ Cripple the free tier (open core trap)
- ❌ Create "community vs. enterprise" code splits
- ❌ Block cloud providers or specific use cases
- ❌ Require commercial licensing for basic usage
- ❌ Retroactively change license terms on shipped versions
- ❌ Create artificial scarcity or forced upgrades

### If We Ever Violate This

You have legal recourse:
1. **Fork rights**: You own the last open version forever
2. **Legal action**: Sue us under Apache 2.0 terms
3. **Community trust**: Non-profit trademark holder can transfer rights to community
4. **Version immortality**: Any released version stays Apache 2.0 forever

## 7. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use this in production?**  
A: Yes. Apache 2.0 is battle-tested, enterprise-approved, and legally solid.

**Q: Can I commercialize this?**  
A: Yes. Build on it, sell it, embed it—no restrictions.

**Q: Do I need a Contributor License Agreement?**  
A: No. Contributions are accepted under the license itself. No extra paperwork.

**Q: What if you go bankrupt?**  
A: The codebase is open. You own what you've downloaded. The community can fork.

**Q: What about patent issues?**  
A: Apache 2.0 includes explicit patent protection. Contributors grant patent rights with their code.

**Q: Can I use this with GPL projects?**  
A: Apache 2.0 is compatible with GPLv3 but not GPLv2. Check your specific use case.

**Q: What's the difference from MIT?**  
A: Apache 2.0 is more comprehensive: explicit patent grants, detailed liability clauses, explicit patent retaliation clause. MIT is simpler.

**Q: Can you change the license to proprietary?**  
A: Only with 75% contributor vote. Old versions stay Apache 2.0 forever. You can fork.
