## License Agreement

### Project: [Project Name]
**Version**: 1.0  
**Effective Date**: [DATE]

---

## 1. Core Framework License (MIT)

The [PROJECT NAME] framework core is licensed under the MIT License:

```
Copyright (c) [YEAR] [COPYRIGHT HOLDER]

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights

copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,

```

### What This Means

You can:
- ✅ Use the framework for any purpose (commercial, personal, research)
- ✅ Modify the framework for your needs
- ✅ Distribute copies or modified versions
- ✅ Use it in proprietary projects
- ✅ Fork the project under the same license

You must:
- ✅ Include the copyright notice and license text in copies

You do NOT need to:
- ❌ Share source code of derivative works
- ❌ Contribute improvements back to the project
- ❌ Pay for any license

---

## 2. Paid Services (Optional, Separate From License)

The [PROJECT TEAM] offers optional paid services. **Using the core framework does not require purchasing these services.**

### Service Offerings

| Service | Description | Pricing Model |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Managed Hosting** | Fully managed cloud deployment with automatic updates, backups, scaling | $[X]/user/month |
| **Priority Support** | Direct access to engineering team, <4hr response SLA | $[Y]/month |
| **Training & Onboarding** | Custom workshops, documentation, knowledge transfer | $[Z]/engagement |
| **Custom Features** | Development of project-specific features | $[A]/hour + materials |
| **Enterprise SLA** | 99.9% uptime guarantee, dedicated support engineer | $[B]/month |

### Pricing Philosophy

Pricing is set below the "maximum acceptable price" per the 404Framework formula:

```
Max Acceptable Price = (Project Valuation / Active Users) × (1 - Churn Rate)
```

**Current Metrics** (updated quarterly):
- Project Valuation: $[X]
- Active Users: [Y]
- Churn Rate: [Z%]
- **Maximum Acceptable Price per User**: $[CAP]
- **Our Pricing**: [Our rates are X% of the cap]

## 3. Contributor Rights & Protections

### Your Contributions Are Your Own

When you contribute to [PROJECT], you:
- **Retain copyright** on your work
- **Grant us a license** to use your contribution under the MIT License
- **Can use your contribution** in your own projects under any license

No Contributor License Agreement (CLA) required. No rights transfer.

### License Change Governance

The core framework license is MIT perpetually. Any change requires:

1. **Public Proposal**: 30-day open comment period
2. **Contributor Vote**: Only contributors (weighted by contribution volume) can vote
3. **Supermajority**: 75% approval required to change
4. **Historical Preservation**: Old versions remain MIT forever
5. **Fork Rights**: Contributors can fork under MIT if change is rejected

### Trademark Protection

The [PROJECT] trademark is held by [NON-PROFIT FOUNDATION/COMMUNITY TRUST].

The trademark **cannot** be used to:
- Force commercial licensing
- Block derivative projects from using the name (with attribution)
- Create "official vs. unofficial" editions for licensing purposes

---

## 4. Transparency & Accountability

Every quarter, [PROJECT] publishes:

**Engagement Metrics**:
- Active user count (MAU/DAU)
- Churn rate (% of users lost per period)
- Geographic distribution
- Industry adoption

**Financial Metrics**:
- Project valuation (how calculated)
- Revenue from paid services
- Expenses (team, infrastructure)
- Profit/loss

**Product Metrics**:
- Open issues and response time
- Contributor count
- Release frequency
- Roadmap priorities

**Pricing Metrics**:
- Max acceptable price per formula
- Current pricing
- Discount/grant programs
- Pricing change justification

This transparency prevents the "we need to be sustainable" excuse from triggering license rug-pulls.

## 5. Sustainability Model

### How We Stay Alive

- **Paid services revenue**: Core funding source
- **Sponsorships**: Companies that benefit from the project
- **Grants & donations**: Community support
- **Consulting contracts**: Custom development work

### We Will Never

- ❌ Switch to SSPL, BSL, or proprietary licenses
- ❌ Cripple the free tier to force paid upgrades
- ❌ Create a false "community edition" with limited features
- ❌ Restrict use by cloud providers or competitors
- ❌ Require commercial licensing for basic usage
- ❌ Retroactively change terms on existing versions

**If we ever violate these promises, you have the right to:**
1. Fork under the MIT license (free, legal)
2. Sue us under our own licensing terms
3. Transfer trademark ownership to community trust

---

## 6. Using This License in Your Own Projects

Want to adopt the 404Framework MIT model? Use this template:

1. Replace `[PROJECT NAME]` with your project
2. Replace `[COPYRIGHT HOLDER]` with your name/organization
3. Replace `[YEAR]` with the current year
4. Define your paid services (or remove Section 2 if none)
5. Link to your metrics dashboard
6. Create a `CONTRIBUTORS.md` with the governance rules from Section 3
7. Register your trademark with a non-profit foundation

That's it. You're now 404Framework-compliant.

## 7. FAQ

**Q: Can I use this in my commercial product?**  
A: Yes. The MIT license has no restrictions. You can modify, redistribute, and commercialize freely.

**Q: Do I need to pay for paid services?**  
A: No. The core framework is free forever. Paid services are entirely optional.

**Q: What if you go out of business?**  
A: The MIT license means you own your copy forever. The codebase is open and can be forked. Your investment is safe.

**Q: What if you switch to a proprietary license?**  
A: You have legal protection. The last open version stays MIT forever. You can fork it. Contributors can sue.

**Q: Can you relicense my code without permission?**  
A: No. You retain copyright. You grant us a license; we cannot take ownership. Any core license change requires your vote.

**Q: Why not GPL instead of MIT?**  
A: Both are valid. MIT maximizes compatibility and adoption. GPL requires derivatives to stay open. Choose based on your philosophy.
