# Contributor Rights Agreement (404Framework Template)

**Project**: [PROJECT NAME]  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Effective**: [DATE]

---

## The Promise

This document outlines **your rights as a contributor** to [PROJECT NAME]. We don't ask you to sign away your rights. We ask you to collaborate.

---

## 1. Copyright & Ownership

### Your Work Is Yours

When you contribute code, documentation, or ideas to [PROJECT]:

- ✅ **You retain full copyright** on your contribution
- ✅ **You can reuse your work** in other projects
- ✅ **You can relicense your work** in your own projects
- ✅ **We receive a non-exclusive license** to use your contribution under [PROJECT LICENSE]

### What We Get

By submitting a contribution, you grant us:

- A worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license
- The right to sublicense your work to others under [PROJECT LICENSE]
- The right to use your work in derivative projects
- The right to modify your work (with attribution)

**What we do NOT get**:
- ❌ Ownership of your copyright
- ❌ The right to relicense under proprietary terms
- ❌ Exclusive rights to your work

### Example

You contribute a new feature to [PROJECT]. The feature is copyrighted to you. We license it under [LICENSE]. Later:

- You can use that feature in a competing product (you wrote it)
- We can build on your feature (we have a license)
- Someone else can fork [PROJECT] and use your feature (it's open source)
- [PROJECT] cannot retroactively claim ownership (it's in writing)

---

## 2. No Contributor License Agreement (CLA) Required

### We Don't Use CLAs

Traditional CLAs ask you to:
- ❌ Transfer copyright to the project
- ❌ Grant exclusive rights
- ❌ Agree to indemnification clauses
- ❌ Sign over your contributions

**We don't do this.** Contributions are accepted under the project license itself. No extra paperwork. No rights transfer.

### How It Works

By opening a pull request, you implicitly state: _"I own this code and license it under [PROJECT LICENSE]."_

That's it. We trust you. We don't need legal forms.

### Large Contributions

For very large contributions (>10,000 lines, new major feature, etc.), we may ask:
- A written statement that you own/have rights to the code
- Confirmation that the code doesn't contain proprietary material
- A brief note on any dependencies or legal considerations

But this is a conversation, not a contract.

---

## 3. Patent Rights

### You Grant Patent Licenses

If your contribution includes technology you have patents on, you grant:

- A worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to [PROJECT] and its users
- The right for others to use your patented technology under the [PROJECT LICENSE]
- This license is limited to what's necessary for your contribution

### You Keep Your Patents

- ✅ You retain patent ownership
- ✅ You can license the patent elsewhere
- ✅ You can enforce it against competitors (outside [PROJECT])
- ✅ The license is non-exclusive

### Example

You contribute code that uses your patented algorithm. We get a license to use it in [PROJECT]. You can:
- Sell the patent elsewhere
- License it to competitors
- Enforce it against someone who stole it and sells it separately
- Sublicense it in your own products

---

## 4. License Change Governance

### The Core License Is Locked

[PROJECT]'s core license is [MIT/APACHE/GPL/AGPL]. **This cannot change without your agreement.**

### How License Changes Work

If the [PROJECT] team proposes changing the license, here's the process:

#### Phase 1: Proposal (30 days)
- Public announcement of proposed license change
- Clear rationale for the change
- Impact assessment (what changes, what stays the same)
- 30-day open comment period
- Contributors can ask questions; we answer

#### Phase 2: Voting (14 days)
- All contributors (even inactive ones) are notified
- Vote is held for 14 days
- Weighted voting: 1 vote per person, plus bonus votes for major contributors
  - 10+ commits: +1 vote
  - 100+ commits: +2 votes
  - 1000+ commits: +3 votes
  - Cap at +3 votes per person
- Result is public

#### Phase 3: Decision
- **Approved**: 75% or higher approval
  - New license applies to future versions
  - All past versions remain under the original license
  - Contributors have 30 days to fork under the original license before new code is released
- **Rejected**: License stays the same
  - Proposal is archived
  - Cannot be re-proposed for 12 months

### What You're Protected From

- ❌ **Unilateral changes**: Team cannot change the license alone
- ❌ **Retroactive restrictions**: Old versions stay open forever
- ❌ **Surprise license locks**: You'll always have 30-day notice + voting rights
- ❌ **Proprietary relicensing**: Only OSI-approved licenses can be adopted

### Your Fork Rights

If a license change you dislike is approved, you can:

1. **Fork the project** under the original license (legal right)
2. **Take all contributors' code** (it's open source)
3. **Continue development** independently
4. **Maintain the original license** indefinitely

This is not a threat; it's a safety valve. The possibility of forking keeps us honest.

## 5. Contributor Rights Protection

### Rights You Have

✅ **Copyright**: You own your contributions  
✅ **Reuse**: You can use your code in other projects

✅ **Transparency**: You can see all governance decisions  

### What We Won't Do

❌ **Claim ownership**: We'll never assert copyright over your code  
❌ **Relicense without vote**: License changes require 75% approval  
❌ **Restrict reuse**: Use your code anywhere you want  
❌ **Demand indemnification**: You're not liable for bugs we cause  
❌ **Revoke contributions**: Your code stays in the repo unless you ask  
❌ **Hide decisions**: Voting records and rationale are public
